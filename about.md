Hey! I'm a software developer living in Morgantown, WV. I enjoy being a polyglot developer, but I usually work with Golang, Ruby, Java, and others. I hold a BS in Computer Science from West Virginia University Institute of Technology as well as a MS in Computer Science and Computer Forensics certificate from West Virginia University.

I also enjoy playing disc golf, repairing arcade boards, playing video games, and writing in my spare time.
