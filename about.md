Hey! I'm a software developer living in Morgantown, WV. I enjoy being a polygot developer, but I usually work with Golang, Ruby, Java, and others.

I also enjoy playing disc golf, repairing arcade boards, playing video games, and writing in my spare time.

I hope you find my writings useful and entertaining!
