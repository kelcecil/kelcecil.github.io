### Leveling Up in Your Dev Career (Working Title)
### University of Pittsburgh (April 10th)

#### Abstract

Pending, but I'm basically going to talk young developers through details they should consider when shaping their early development career.


### Shorty Circuits (with Dan Mace)
### CuriousityQuest: Hosted by the Morgantown Public Library

#### Abstract

Electronics are everywhere in our world, and understanding them will open the door to creating amazing things! This class will guide kids through building their first circuit. They'll learn about the circuit they'll be building as well as how to (safely) use a soldering iron to attach the circuit components to a board. Kids will leave with a finished electronics project to show off to their family and friends as well as direction to continue their study of the amazing world of electronics.
